/* Intro - 5
Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.

Example

For n = 2, the output should be
solution(n) = 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
solution(n) = 13.
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[input] integer n

Guaranteed constraints:
1 â‰¤ n < 104.

[output] integer

The area of the n-interesting polygon.

function solution(n) {
  var area = 1;
  for (var i = 2, j = 4; i <= n; i++, j += 4) {
    area += j;
  }
  return area;
}

console.log(solution(2)); // 5
console.log(solution(3)); // 13
console.log(solution(1)); // 1
console.log(solution(5)); // 41
